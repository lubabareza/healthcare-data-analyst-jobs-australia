The Opportunity
We’re looking for a detail-focused, organised and purpose-driven
Research Officer
to support the day-to-day operations of the
Australian Dementia Network (ADNeT) Registry
,
a national initiative aimed at improving care and outcomes for people living with dementia and mild cognitive impairment.
Whether you're early in your career or building on prior experience, this is an opportunity to contribute to a national program shaping the future of dementia care across Australia. You'll work closely with a supportive and collaborative team of registry experts, researchers and clinicians based at
Monash University’s School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine
, Australia’s leading public health school.
About you
You are someone who thrives in structured, research-focused environments. You value accuracy, follow-through and high-quality work, and you’re at your best when working on tasks that matter. You enjoy supporting systems that run smoothly, and you're comfortable managing a variety of responsibilities—from supporting patient recruitment activities, helping prepare ethics and governance documents to handling sensitive participant data.
You're known for your ability to stay organised, communicate clearly and pick up new systems quickly. Most importantly, you care about contributing to research that makes a real-world difference.
What you’ll do
Undertake patient recruitment activities
Support registry operational activities
Administrative service coordination
Support ethics and governance activities
Provide front-line and administrative services
Maintain an organised document repository
Assist with research-related activities
What you bring
A tertiary qualification or equivalent experience in a relevant area (e.g. health, research, administration)
Strong administrative and organisational skills, with a keen eye for detail and a proactive work style
Clear written and verbal communication skills, and the ability to handle sensitive data confidentially
Experience working in a research, clinical or registry setting is advantageous, but not essential
This is more than an administrative support role — it’s an opportunity to be part of a national research initiative that’s transforming the way dementia care is delivered in Australia.
You’ll join a dedicated and collaborative team within Monash University’s
Clinical Outcomes data Reporting and Research Program (CORRP)
, working alongside leading researchers and clinicians. You’ll be supported in your professional growth, exposed to cutting-edge registry systems, and be part of a workplace that values inclusion, flexibility and real-world impact.
